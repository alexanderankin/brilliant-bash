# Brilliant Bash

A handful of bash aliases to strengthen the bond between you and your machine.

Special thanks to everyone who contributes to this repository. Using the command line should be fun, right?

### Installation

Clone this repo inside of where you store your dotfiles with:

```
git clone https://github.com/roytenberg/brilliant-bash
```

Then, comment out the aliases you don't want with your text editor of choice.

### Examples

Shell aliases are meant to take one command (or more, with functions), and simplify them to something more memorable/easy to type.

Therefore, instead of typing...

```
git push origin master
```

You can easily do the same thing with four letters with our alias...

```
gpom
```
